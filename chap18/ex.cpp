4. Consider what happens if you give strdup(), findx(), and strcmp() an argument
   that is not a C-style string. Try it! First figure out how to get a char*
   that doesn’t point to a zero-terminated array of characters and then use it
   (never do this in real — non-experimental — code; it can create havoc). Try
   it with free-store-allocated and stack-allocated “fake C-style strings.” If
   the results still look reasonable, turn off debug mode. Redesign and re-
   implement those three functions so that they take another argument giving the
   maximum number of elements allowed in argument strings. Then, test that with
   correct C-style strings and “bad” strings.

5. Write a function, string cat_dot(const string& s1, const string& s2), that

8. Rewrite all the functions in §18.7 to use the approach of making a backward

   "emoh", and compare those two strings to see that they are different, so home
   isn’t a palindrome.

9. Consider the memory layout in §17.4. Write a program that tells the order in
   which static storage, the stack, and the free store are laid out in memory.
   In which direction does the stack grow: upward toward higher addresses or
   downward toward lower addresses? In an array on the free store, are elements
   with higher indices allocated at higher or lower addresses?

    (b) allowing an arbitrarily long string. Comment on the complexity of the
    two versions.

/*
11. Look up (e.g., on the web) skip list and implement that kind of list. This
    is not an easy exercise.

/*
12. Implement a version of the game “Hunt the Wumpus.” “Hunt the Wumpus” (or
    just “Wump”) is a simple (non-graphical) computer game originally invented
    by Gregory Yob. The basic premise is that a rather smelly monster lives in a
    dark cave consisting of connected rooms. Your job is to slay the wumpus
    using bow and arrow. In addition to the wumpus, the cave has two hazards:
    bottomless pits and giant bats. If you enter a room with a bottomless pit,
    it’s the end of the game for you. If you enter a room with a bat, the bat
    picks you up and drops you into another room. If you enter the room with the
    wumpus or he enters yours, he eats you. When you enter a room you will be
    told if a hazard is nearby: “I smell the wumpus”: It’s in an adjoining room.
    “I feel a breeze”: One of the adjoining rooms is a bottomless pit. “I hear a
    bat”: A giant bat is in an adjoining room. For your convenience, rooms are
    numbered. Every room is connected by tunnels to three other rooms. When
    entering a room, you are told something like “You are in room 12; there are
    tunnels to rooms 1, 13, and 4; move or shoot?” Possible answers are m13
    (“Move to room 13”) and s13–4–3 (“Shoot an arrow through rooms 13, 4, and
    3”). The range of an arrow is three rooms. At the start of the game, you
    have five arrows. The snag about shooting is that it wakes up the wumpus and
    he moves to a room adjoining the one he was in — that could be your room.
    Probably the trickiest part of the exercise is to make the cave by selecting
    which rooms are connected with whichother rooms. You’ll probably want to use
    a random number generator (e.g., randint() from std_lib_facilities.h) to
    make different runs of the program use different caves and to move around
    the bats and the wumpus. Hint: Be sure to have a way to produce a debug
    output of the state of the cave.
